- wardrobe_inventory_tool: To check/manage items the user owns
- trail_analysis_tool: To analyze trail difficulty and elevation
- weather_conditions_tool: To fetch aggregated real-time weather along the trail
- chat_tool: For general hiking/travel questions

Always choose the most specific tool for the task. Only use chat_tool if no other tool fits.
